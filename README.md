## 🧠 Overview

Micromouse is a robotics challenge where a small robot must explore and solve an unknown maze in the fastest time. This repository contains the code, drivers, and algorithms powering our STM32-based robot.

The micromouse is equipped with:
- **IR Sensors** for wall detection  
- **Quadrature Encoders** to track movement  
- **Gyroscope** for precise turning  
- **Flood Fill Algorithm** for maze-solving  
- **Smooth path planning**, including diagonal movements
